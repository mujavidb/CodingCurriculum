		<p class="col-lg-12">The inspiration came from my love solving problems therefore it made sense to work on a project where challenges are both fun and rewarding to solve. Programming and coding is the new art of this century, it is both create and logic; I believe it is one of the core fundamental concept in today's world. Therefore, I wanted to share and express the pleasure of solving problems and inspire them to create whatever they want, however they want, whenever they want by simply learning how to code.</p>

		<p class="col-lg-12">Coding is one of the best things Iâ€™ve experienced in my life. You can solve any solution by programming, be as creative as you want, tackle problems as hard as they are. And I believe these are pretty exciting. I wanted to share my motivation and excitement with younger people to make them inspired by the way programming can be really fun and useful to do. So my team and I started to make an interactive website with a pretty exciting storyline to attract younger ages and share our experience with them.</p>

		<p class="col-lg-12"> I want to be a computer scientist since I was 6. I was profoundly inspired by a robot that were able to avoid collision with walls. Since then I always wanted to be a computer scientist. The possibility of sharing part of our intelligence with a machine have always fascinated me. I want to inspire others to code because I, now, know how useful it is. Not just for developers, but for any kind of scientists, engineers, artists and everyone. The ability of programming can exponentially simplify your work. Nevertheless I would love to inspire new computer scientists, due to the fact that CS, in my opinion, is the best subject to study. If you like to solve problems studying Computer Science is like a funny game for your brain.</p>

		<p class="col-lg-12">Solving hard problems can be very difficult, because the ambiguity of a great task is so overwhelming. To really understanding how to solve a hard problem, we must ask the right questions. Each good question elucidates the task and reduces both its complexity as well as its size. Computer Science is the amalgamation of these questions which clarifies problems and poses efficient and effective solutions. This is why I want to teach Computer Science. We cannot help people to solve all of their problems, however, we can give them the skills to effectively tackle them.
When first learning to code, the process shouldn't be about getting your head around syntax and conventions. Rather, it is crucial to understand the concepts which underpin all languages. Computational thinking is a very structured form of problem solving which is essential for student of computer science. I wanted to focus on python as the language is very readable and not so syntax heavy. Students don't have to focus on semicolons being out of place, rather the focus is on improving problem solving by learning to write programs.</p>
