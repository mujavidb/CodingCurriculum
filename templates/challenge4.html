                    <h3>Functions</h3>

                    <p>{{$storage.name}}, we have come a long way and you have learn very valuable and critical skills to help us defeating the Laggers. This is the final stage, If we can make it through building the cypher, we can finally encrypt the mystery of how to defeat TeamLag. One of the earliest encryption methods was to cyclically shift the letters of the alphabet by a fixed amount, an offset between 0 and 26.</p>

                    <p>As you know creating ciphers is very important {{$storage.name}}, they allow us to so only limit the amount of people knowing our messages and by understanding them you can learn to how to decode The Laggers messages and defeat the once and for all. </p>

                    <p>To complete your final challenge you will need to use all of your previous knowledge and combine them together to be successful in your adventure, but before we get stuck in I will need you to teach you to how to create functions.</p>

                    <p>So to be able to create organised and reusable programs you will need to be able to create functions. A function is a block of organised/reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. By doing so you will make your program more readable and you will also find by making your programs into smaller chunks of functions your original problem becomes much easier.</p>

                    <p>So a few rules when you are defining a function:</p>
                    <ul>
						<li>
							Function blocks begin with the keyword <code>def</code> followed by the name you choose and parentheses. For example:<br>
                            <pre>def functionName(parameters):</pre>
							Any input parameter or arguments should be placed inside the parenthesis and remember you can have more than one parameter inside. 
						</li>
						<li>
							The first statement of a function can also be an optional statement. This is useful since you can describe in string format  what the function will be used for or add any other useful information. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Remember not to forget the colon (:) at the end as the code block within every function starts with a colon. 
						</li>
						<li>
							The statement return exits a function and literally “returns” the value you have decided back to the function. A return statement with no arguments is the same as return None. 
						</li>
					</ul>

                    <p>A typical function body looks like the code below:</p>

                    <pre>def printThisMessage(string):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# This program prints  a passed string into this function<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print string</pre>

                    <h3>Calling a Function</h3>

                    <p>So we have been through defining a simple function. However after specifying the parameters and structuring the blocks of code you will need to know how to call the function to make use of it. You can execute it from another function or directly from the Python prompt itself.</p>

                    <p>For example:</p>

                    <pre>def printThisMessage(string):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# This program prints  a passed string into this function <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print string<br><br># Now you can call printThisMessage function<br>printThisMessage(“Hello this is my first message”)<br>printThisMessage(“Hello this is my second message”)</pre>

                    <p>Output:</p>

                    <pre>Hello this is my first message<br>Hello this is my second message</pre>

                    <h3>The return statement:</h3>
					
                    <p>So as explained earlier the return statement exits a function and optionally passing back an expression to the caller. I will be showing you an example on how you can return a value from a function. </p>
                    
                    <p>For example: </p>

                    <pre>def sumOfNumbers(number1, number2):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return number1 + number2<br><br>#calling the sumOfNumbers function<br>sumOfNumbers(10,20)</pre>

                    <p>Output:</p>

                    <pre>30</pre>

                    <p>So as you can observe by returning the total in the sumOfNumbers function when the code executed with those parameters the correct total is calculated.</p>

						<h3>Challenge 1</h3>
						<p>We can cycle a list by a fixed amount by taking the given number of items off the front and adding them to the back  of the list. Write a function called rotate.
						</p>
						<p>For example rotate (6 ,"ABCDEFGHIJKLMN") returns "GHIJKLMNABCDEF". </p>
						<p>Make sure it returns an error message if the offset number is less than 0 or bigger than or equal to the length of the string. 
						After having created the function call it with 6 and “ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ” as parameters.</p>
					</div>
					
        
                    <div ng-show="counter >= 2">
						<h3>Challenge 2</h3>
						<p>Assume keys are given in terms of upper case letters only. Use the function rotate to write a function called createKey that produces a string of 26 pairs of upper case letters which give the cipher key.</p>
						<p>createKey function will take an offset amount and returns a list of tuples where the first member of a pair is a member of the alphabet and the second is the member of the alphabet that the offset pairs the first one with. Call the function with 8 as offset.</p>
						<p>For example a tuple can be like:</p>
						<pre>myTuple = (2, "a", "bug")</pre>
						<p>A list of Tuples would be like:</p>
						<pre>myList = [(2, "a"),(3, "b"),(4, "Lagger")]</pre>

						<h4><strong>Hint</strong></h4>
						<p>What are Tuples in Python? </p>
						<p>The are pretty much the same as Lists except that once they are declared they can’t be changed. Also the data stored in tuples can be heterogeneous while the data stored in lists must be homogeneous.</p>
					</div>
        
                    
        
                    <div ng-show="counter >= 3">
						<h3>Challenge 3</h3>
						<p>Now we need you Robo{{$storage.name}} to write a function lookUp which gets the first char in a key and finds a pair in a key by its first character and returns its second character. If the character is not in the key it should return it unchanged. When you have created the function call it with "A" and use as a list of pairs the one that you can produce with the prevoius function using an offset of 7.</p>
						<h4><strong>Hint</strong></h4>
						<p>You should call the function in the previous challenge and store the return value in a variable.
You’ll need that variable for this challenge!!! the function will look like this: lookUp(firstChar,listOfPairs).</p>
					</div>
        
                    <div ng-show="counter >= 4"><h3>Challenge 4</h3>
						<p>Write a function encipher which takes two arguments, an offset and a single uppercase character  and encrypts it using the given offset.</p>
						<p>For example encipher(5, "C") returns H. You should then call the function with 8 and B and arguments.</p>
					</div>
        
                    <div ng-show="counter >= 5"><h3>Challenge 5</h3>
						<p>Text encrypted by a cipher is conventionally written in uppercase and without punctuation.</p>
						<p>Write a function normalise which gets a string of characters as an argument and converts the string to uppercase, removing spaces and all characters other than letters and digits and returns it. Call the function with "Hello my name is Maria!!!"</p>
					</div>
                    
        
                    <div ng-show="counter >= 6"><h3>Challenge 6</h3>
						<p>Write a function encipherString which takes two arguments an offset and a string of characters and what is does is, it normalises the string and then encrypts it and print the final string on the console.</p>
						<p>For example:</p>
						<p>encipherString 18 "We move at 1500 hours" becomes:</p>
						<p>"OWEGNWSL1500ZGMJK". <br> Call the function with an offset of 6 and the string: "Hello, how are you?"</p>
